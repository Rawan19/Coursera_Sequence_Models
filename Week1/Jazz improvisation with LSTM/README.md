# Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network

In this notebook, I implemented a model that uses an LSTM to generate music.

## Problem statement

You would like to create a jazz music piece specially for a friend's birthday. 
However, you don't know any instruments or music composition. 
Fortunately, you know deep learning and will solve this problem using an LSTM network.

You will train a network to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work.

Following the code, You will learn to:

  *  Apply an LSTM to music generation.
  * Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.
