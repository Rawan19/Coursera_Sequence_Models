# Operations on word vectors


This assignment is devided into three parts:

   1 - Load pre-trained word vectors, and measure similarity using cosine similarity
   
  (Because word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train, most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings.
)
   
   2- Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to __.
   
  3- Modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias
